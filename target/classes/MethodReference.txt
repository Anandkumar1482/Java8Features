>method reference is nothing refer one method to already existing method
  no need to write a separate method for this requirement we have to make code 
  re-usability.
->method reference is alternative to Lambda expression. no need to write lambda 
 expression we have to re-use already existing method.

Method Reference is applicable 
============================
static method
instance method

1)For the instance methods
--------------------------------------------------------
we have to call method reference by using 
ex:
Test t=new Test();
t::m1();
ObjectReference :: MethodName

2)For the static method 
-----------------------------------------------------------
we have to call method reference by using 
ex:
Test::m1()
ClassName :: MethodName

note:
in method reference arguments should be same only.
public void run();
public void m1();
   Except arguments remaining 
   the method name,return type,modifiers not required to worry.

in the case of different return types is possible.
